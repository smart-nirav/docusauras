- Do all reviews and PRs in XFSC repositories, if this is done on fork, there is a leak in openess and transparency. (https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/forking_workflow.html#create-a-fork) ??  
- Write meaningful and descriptive commit messages, look for example [here](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/), [here](https://medium.com/better-programming/your-git-commit-history-should-read-like-a-history-book-heres-how-7f44d5df1801) or here for [conventional committs](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). 
- Avoid references to closed systems, as this is not tracable for newcomers.

### Onboarding Process

- Review the project's contribution guidelines and code of conduct.
- Set up the development environment as per project requirements.
- Fork the repository to their personal space on Eclipse’s GitLab.  
- Clone the repository to their local machine.
- Create a new branch for their contributions.
- Submit a merge request (MR, aka PR on GitLab) for their changes.  
- Engage publicly in discussions and revisions as needed. 
- Once the MR is approved, their contributions are merged into the repository by a committer. 
- New contributors may be assigned a mentor for guidance and support.  

### Work Stream 

- Contributors work on their assigned features, components, or modules within the repository. 
- Maintain an active, public communication channel for contributors to collaborate and seek assistance (e.g., mailing list of GitLab’s issues).  
- Regularly update the repository with new features, bug fixes, and improvements.
