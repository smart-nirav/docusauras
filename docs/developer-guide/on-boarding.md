title: Onboarding Contributers
---

Contributing to the Eclipse XFSC project means code, documentation, creating and solving issues (bugs), answering questions in public systems e.g. on the dev mailing list to support the community in an open and transparent way. See also the [Eclipse Foundation Project Handbook](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#contributing). 

### How to Become a Contributor:  

This section provides information and links to relevant resources before you start contributing to Eclipse XFSC Project and onboarding of contributors:

- Create Eclipse Foundation account [here](https://accounts.eclipse.org/user/register)
- Use the same email address that you use in GitLab for your contributions, e.g. if you contribute on behalf of your company, you must create the account with your company email address
- Sign the [Eclipse Contributor Agreement (ECA)](https://www.eclipse.org/legal/ECA.php)
- Add your **GitLab ID** to your Eclipse profile (Section: Social Media Links)  
- Subscribe to the Eclipse [XFSC Mailing List:](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.xfsc/contact) 
- Sending an email to the project’s mailing list or lauresha.memeti@eco.de to ask for contributors role.
- Get familiar with the [Eclipse Foundation Project Handbook](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/)

### Dev Mailinglist​: 

The dev mailinglist is the official channel for project communication, use it for questions, announcing news or discuss relevant topics.  

All of the answers don’t need to necessarily come from project committers: empower your community to answer questions. When community members do provide answers that require further clarification (either they are not complete, or are not 100% correct), do so politely. The more welcome you make your community feel, the more likely it is that your project will be successful.

XFSC Dev Mail adress: https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.xfsc/contact

Every contributor should be subscribed to https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.xfsc/contact. (Committers have to be subscribed to the list and are added automatically when gaining the committer status).
