title: Project Roles
---

In Eclipse projects there are several roles that are important to know. We show you the most important ones, for more information see the Handbook. You can also watch this [training video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yna8V2sOqws&feature=youtu.be) on the Eclipse YouTube channel.


### Contributor

Anyone with an Eclipse account and a signed ECA is an Eclipse contributor. Contributors have read access. On GitLab repositories they have the read role. 

Eclipse XFSC Contributor List: [https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.xfsc/who  ](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.xfsc/who) Committers can add new contributors to the XFSC project, see the [Handbook](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#pmi-contributors) for details. 

Note: This is the PMI (Project Management Interface) [https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.xfsc](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.xfsc). 

### Committer

Eclipse XFSC Committer List: [https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.xfsc/who](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.xfsc/who)  For Eclipse projects (and the open source world in general), committers are the ones who hold the keys. 

Committers decide what code goes into the code base, they decide how a project builds, and they ultimately decide what gets delivered to the adopter community. With awesome power, comes awesome responsibility, and so the Open Source Rules of Engagement described by the Eclipse Foundation Development Process, puts meritocracy on equal footing with transparency and openness: becoming a committer isn’t necessarily hard, but it does require a demonstration of merit. (From the [Handbook](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#roles-cm)) 

Tasks:

- Operate in an open, transparent, and meritocratic manner;  
- Write code (and other project content) and can push it directly into the project’s source code repository;  
- Review contributions (merge and pull requests) from contributors;  
- Engage in the Intellectual Property Due Diligence Process;  
- Nominate new committer;  
- Vote in committer and project lead elections;  
- Engage in the project planning process;  
- Otherwise represent the interests of the open source project.  

On repositories committer have the write role.  


### Contributers vs. Committers

- Contributors:

  - Individuals who have expressed their intent to contribute to the project.  
  - Contribute by submitting pull requests (MRs) with changes.
  - May have limited access to merge MRs, typically requiring approval from committers or maintainers.
  - Expected to follow the project's contribution guidelines.  
  - Have the reporter role on XFSC's GitLab.

- Committers:

  - Experienced contributors who have demonstrated a deep understanding of the project and Eclipse processes.
  - Have the authority to merge MRs directly into the repository.
  - Responsible for reviewing and maintaining the quality of contributions, managing issues and vulnerabilities, and supporting contributors.
  - May be involved in project decision-making and roadmap planning.
  - Have the developer role on XFSC's GitLab.

### Eclipse Project Lead

An Eclipse Project Lead is a project committer with enhanced rights and responsibilities. Each project can have more than one project lead, elected by the project committers. 

Tasks:

- Project leads are responsible for ensuring that project committers are following the rules.
- Project leads have the ability to retire committers.
- Project leads have to approve e.g. infrastructure request, reviews.

See the [Handbook](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#roles-pl)

### Automotive Project Management Committee (PMC)​

The Automotive Project Management Committee (PMC) is responsible for the operation of [the Automotive Top Level Project](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/automotive). Top level projects are at the top of the open source project hierarchy. More information can be found on the [website](https://eclipse.dev/automotive/).

The PMC consists of experienced committers who are appointed by the EMO or elected by the [PMC members](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/automotive/who).

Tasks:

- The PMC reviews and approves (or vetos) committer and project lead elections, first validating that candidates have demonstrated sufficient merit.
- The PMC is tasked with approving progress, release, and graduation reviews.
- The PMC supports the Eclipse IP Team with knowledge and experience with their community and technology .

Contact the PMC:

Using xfsc-dev 

- To post a message to all the list members, send email to [xfsc-dev@eclipse.org](mailto:xfsc-dev@eclipse.org). You must be subscribed to the list before you can post. To access a web archive of this list, visit the [xfsc-dev Archives](https://www.eclipse.org/lists/xfsc-dev/2024/Jun/index.html) or subscribe to this list's [RSS feed](https://www.eclipse.org/lists/xfsc-dev/maillist.rss)

- Note: You have to be subscribed to the   to write to the list.  

See the [Handbook](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#roles-pmc)

### Eclipse Management Organization (EMO)​  

If you have a question that cannot be answered by project lead, mentor, or PMC, ask the EMO. The best method of contact with the EMO is by email [(emo@eclipse-foundation.org).](mailto:emo@eclipse-foundation.org)

See the [Handbook](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#roles-emo)
