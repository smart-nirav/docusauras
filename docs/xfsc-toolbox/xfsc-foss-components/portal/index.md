The Portal within XFSC toolbox serves as an integration layer, highlighting Federation Services and providing user-friendly access to onboarding, accreditation, service discovery, orchestration, and delivery. It includes key features such as searching, exploring, and displaying content from the Federated Catalogue. Users can register and onboard new Participants, accessing onboarding details, with the Federation approving registrations and issuing verified credentials. Furthermore, Participants can orchestrate and provision services through the portal.
