title: Decentralized Catalogue and Contracting Service (CCS)
---

The Decentralited Catalogue and Contracting Service act as an inventory, allowing participants to discover, understand, and use available data in an ecosystem. The Federated Catalogue serves as a repository for a Federation, enabling participants to find each other's information and services through Self-Descriptions. The toolbox provides code for groups to create their own Catalogue and includes services for contract negotiations and tracking data transactions, giving participants control over their data usage within the group.

- **Federated Catalogue(CAT)** <br/>
  Indexed repository of Gaia-X Self-Descriptions, facilitating the discovery and selection of Providers and their service offerings.

- **Self-Description Wizard (SD-Wizard)** <br/>
  SD Creation Wizard tool assists in creating Gaia-X Self-Descriptions based on ontologies and SHACL shapes. Self-Descriptions describe Entities from the Gaia-X Conceptual Model in a machine-interpretable format.

- **Data Contract Services (DCS)** <br/>
  This service enables the negotiation of contracts, acting as a handshake between the data provider and the data consumer.

- **Data Exchange Logging Service (DEL)** <br/>
  The Data Exchange Logging service provides evidence of data submission and receipt. It ensures that rules and obligations, as outlined in Data Usage Policies, are enforced and indicates whether these have been complied with or violated.
