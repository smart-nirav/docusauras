title: Service Mesh Automation (Orchestration, ORC)
---

ORC function is to manage services selected or created in the Portal by a Participant. It deploys, updates, and deletes services based on actions from the Consumer or Provider. Providing feedback on service status, the Orchestration is accessible through the Portal or directly by a Participant. It defines an API standard for developing "Life Cycle Management (LCM) Services," specialised components for deploying and managing services across different technologies. The central "LCM Engine" coordinates various LCM Services, interfaces with the Portal, and communicates through the API Standard.
