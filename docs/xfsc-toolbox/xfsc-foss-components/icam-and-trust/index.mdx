## ICAM & Trust over IP Identity, Credential and Access Management

These services empower federated ecosystems, like federations, to authenticate and authorise users and systems in a decentralised, self-sovereign manner, ensuring trust without depending on a central authority. These services utilise credential validation and technology functionalities to maintain a consistent level of trust among all participants in the federation.
