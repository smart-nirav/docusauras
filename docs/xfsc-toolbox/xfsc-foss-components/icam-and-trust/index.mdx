## ICAM & Trust over IP Identity, Credential and Access Management

These services empower federated ecosystems, like federations, to authenticate and authorise users and systems in a decentralised, self-sovereign manner, ensuring trust without depending on a central authority. These services utilise credential validation and technology functionalities to maintain a consistent level of trust among all participants in the federation.

- **Personal Credential Manager (PCM)**
  Digital SSI wallet utilised by individuals, typically in the form of a personal wallet, for managing and storing credentials.

- **Trust Services API (TSA)** <br />
  Technical implementation ensuring policy enforcement for the decentralised and self-sovereign components within Gaia-X.

- **Notarisation Service (NOT)**
