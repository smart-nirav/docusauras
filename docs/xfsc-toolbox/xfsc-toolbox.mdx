### XFSC Specifications Phase 1

The **[“Specification Phase 1”](https://www.gxfs.eu/specification-phase-1/)** page provides an overview of all, technical
specifications that were prepared in spring 2021 and awarded in an EU-wide
tender. In December 2021, the successful bidders were published,
implementing a first set of federation services and thus enabling an open
source reference implementation of GXFS.

### XFSC Specification Phase 2

The second Phase of the XFSC specification builds upon the groundwork laid in GXFS
specification [Phase 1](https://gaia-x.gitlab.io/technical-committee/federation-services/federation-service-specifications/) and aligns with the principles of the [Gaia-X Trust Framework
22.10.](https://docs.gaia-x.eu/policy-rules-committee/trust-framework/22.10/)  [The recently defined specifications and supplementary requirements](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse/xfsc/xfsc-spec-2/-/blob/main/Spec2Overview.md?ref_type=heads) apply to
these specific components.
