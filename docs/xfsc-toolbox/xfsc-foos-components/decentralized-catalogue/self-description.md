title: Self-Description Wizard (SD-Wizard)
---

The SD Creation Wizard is developed to assist in creating [Gaia-X Self-Descriptions](https://gaia-x.gitlab.io/technical-committee/architecture-document/self-description/) based on ontologies and SHACL shapes. Self-Descriptions describe Entities from the Gaia-X Conceptual Model in a machine interpretable format.
