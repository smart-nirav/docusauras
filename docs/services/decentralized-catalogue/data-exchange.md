title: Data Exchange Logging Service (DELS)
---

In this tender the lot “Data Exchange Logging Service” (DELS) is being awarded. The purpose of the service functions to be implemented is to provide evidence that data has been (a) submitted and (b) received and (c) rules and obligations (Data Usage Policies) were enforced or violated within the Gaia-X ecosystem. This supports the clearing of operational issues, but also eventually the clearing of fraudulent transactions. 

Additionally, the data consumer can track and provide evidence on the enforcement or violation of data usage policies. The log can be used as a basis for clearing and billing, but this is not in scope of the Gaia-X Federation Services for Release 1. 

From a functional perspective, the DELS provides an interface to track logging notifications and to read the logging messages afterward. The logging mechanism is specified in accordance with W3C linked data notifications.
